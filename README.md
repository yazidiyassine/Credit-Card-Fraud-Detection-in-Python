# Project Title: Credit Card Fraud Detection in Python
This is a project that aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using Python. The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle's Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset.

## Project Description
The project consists of three main parts:

### Data exploration and visualization
This part involves analyzing and visualizing the data to understand the features and identify any patterns or anomalies.

### Data preprocessing
This part involves preparing the data for the machine learning algorithms by handling missing values, scaling the features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

### Machine learning
This part involves building and training machine learning models to predict fraudulent transactions. The machine learning models used in this project are:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

## Requirements
The project requires the following Python packages:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

These packages can be installed using pip.

## Credits
The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle's Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset.
